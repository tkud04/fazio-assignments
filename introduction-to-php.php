a) Using these variables and a PHP echo statement output the message 'Hi Fred. Your favourite colour is red. Your favourite website is http://www.hud.ac.uk.'

a) In order to pass a module students must get an overall mark that is greater or equal to 40. Write a PHP if statement that will test if $overall is greater than or equal to 40. If it is, use an echo statement to output "passed". If it isn't use an echo statement to output "failed"

The Kaboom Gas company charge their customers for gas as follows:
Units of Gas Used Cost(£)
Units of Gas:0 to 500 Cost:£10
Units of Gas:501 to 1000 Cost:£10 + 5p for each unit over 500
Units of Gas:Over 1000 Cost:£35 + 3p for each unit over 1000
